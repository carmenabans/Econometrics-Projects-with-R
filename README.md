# Econometrics Projects with R

This repository contains two projects completed as part of an Econometrics course using R.

## Project 1: Analysis of Worker Data

This project analyzes data from American workers, including their earnings and physical characteristics.

# Computer Project 1

**Author:** Carmen Abans

## Overview:
This project involves the analysis of earnings and height data of a sample of US workers. The data is examined through statistical summary and regression analysis in R.

### What it does?

**a) Data Import:**
Use the `read.csv` command to import the `Earnings_and_Height.csv` dataset into R. Then, use the `attach` command to attach the dataset.

**b) Data Summary:**
Print out a summary of the dataset, including the sample average of earnings, height, and sex variables.

**c) Regression Analysis:**
Run a regression of earnings on height. Interpret the meaning of the regression coefficient for the height variable.

**d) Visualization:**
Plot a graph of earnings over height and add a fitted line of the regression.

**e) Prediction:**
Predict the earnings for individuals of specified heights based on the regression model.

**f) Analysis Metrics:**
Find and interpret the R-squared (R²) and standard error of the regression (SER) from the regression analysis.

**g) Hypothesis Testing:**
Perform a t-test on the height variable to determine its significance in the regression model.

**h) Confidence Interval:**
Calculate the confidence interval (CI) of the height variable and interpret its significance.

**i) Gender Analysis:**
Run a regression of earnings on sex and interpret the regression coefficients.


## Project 2: Relationship between Age and Earnings

This project investigates the relationship between age and earnings for workers in certain demographic groups.

### What it does?

**a) Data Import:**
Use the `read.csv` command to import the `CPS12.csv` dataset into R. Then, use the `attach` command to attach the dataset.

**b) Data Summary:**
Print out a summary of the dataset, including the sample average of earnings, age, gender, and education variables.

**c) Regression Analysis:**
Run a regression of earnings on age, gender, and education variables. Interpret the meaning of the regression coefficients.

**d) Prediction:**
Predict the earnings for individuals with specified demographic characteristics based on the regression model.

**e) Analysis Metrics:**
Find and interpret the R-squared (R²) and adjusted R-squared (R²) from the regression analysis.

**f) Model Comparison:**
Compare the performance of different regression models using F-tests.

**g) Hypothesis Testing:**
Perform hypothesis testing to determine the significance of demographic variables in the regression model.

**h) Logarithmic Analysis:**
Run regression models using logarithmic transformations and compare their performance.
